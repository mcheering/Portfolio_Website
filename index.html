              <p style="color:white;">Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Matthew Heering, and I am curretnly a
                science teacher in St. Louis, MIssouri.
                I teach Pre-AP and AP Biology, and I coach Girls' lacrosse. Outside of teaching I enjoy technology, ice
                hockey, and photography. I keep up with current
                trends in tech to stay fresh. I enjoy seeing all the new software and gadgets. One hobby of mine that's
                pushed me further into tech
                has been hackintoshing. I have a prject computer that I work on. My goal is to make it feel as close to
                real mac as I can. It's given me some headaches
                but when I get a lot of satisfaction when I solve a problem. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="float-left">
              <p style="color:white;">While teaching is a fun profession, I find myself wanting to move more and more
                into the tech space.
                I leanred Swift, the programming language for iOS, and MacOS, last year. As I've dived into this I cam
                across full-stack web development.
                This career seems to offer a lot of the things I enjoy about teaching, but also the things I enjoy about
                tech. I enjoy challenges, and both teaching
                and tech provide that. But going into full stack development provides me an opportunity to build
                something. I love the instant gratification of building and testing
                in real time. You can type somehting out and almost instantaneously see how it works on the. I can
                tinker with my work and adjust like I do
                with my hackintosh. If I decide to leave teaching, I beleive I have a future in this space. But if I
                decide to continue teaching, I can use these skills
                in my classroom to build a site for my classroom and provide interacive quizzes that will communicate
                with the learning managaemnt API to send data. No matter what,
                there is something to be gained. However, at the moment, I am defintely leaning towards leaving the
                world of teaching, to pursue a career as a full stack web developer. </p>
