This project provides an opportunity to dive into bootstrap css framework to build a fuly functional wesbite that is reponsive to browser window size as small as a mobile device.  The website consists of three pages.  An "about" page where I give a little background into myself, this is my index.html file.  A "portfolio" page where I provide a link to my instagram account and sample photos I've taken around the St. Louis region.  And a "contact" page where a user could send a message to me.  I came across a dynamic background that has particles moving and connecting to each other with lines.  I dove into the world of javascript to figure out that problem.  The other feature I implmemented, albeit buggy, is for the navbar to diseapper while sccrolling.  It's a work in progress, but it was a way for me to practice implementing javascript into my documents.  Overall, I'm proud of this website, and happy about how it turned out.  Below is a link to the page.
